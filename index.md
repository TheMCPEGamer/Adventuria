###About
Adventuria is a 2D platformer based upon the popular games Minecraft & Terraria.
Currently it is written in Java, and may soon have some pretty cool features (ie: built-in Modding API)

###Pre-compiled binaries (Downloads)
Right now Adventuria is in developers-only Alpha stage, and cannot be downloaded.
If you know how to use Eclipse, and know Java, download Adventuria's source code from it's repository!
